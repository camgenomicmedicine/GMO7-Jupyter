# Practical A: Introducing Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebook is an "open-source web application that allows you 
to create and share documents that contain live Python code, equations,
visualizations and narrative text" (http://jupyter.org/). 
This means that you can write Python code in your web browser 
(Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and mix in human readable text.

Juypter notebooks are really useful for scientists because
they make "data analysis easier to record, understand and reproduce" 
as explained in this
[Nature Article: Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code
](http://doi.org/10.1038/515151a). 
Note that the article discusses Juypter Notebooks 
using their original name "IPython Notebooks". 
I use Jupyter Notebook in my research, for instance 
including a (HTML version of a)  
[Jupyter notebook containing data analysis and graph plotting
](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318002541/ba5278sup3.html), 
as part of a
[research paper](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318002541).

## Getting Started Instructions using Google Colab

Google Colab is a service that allows you to run and work on Jupyter 
in the cloud. 
* If you do not have a local Jupyter Notebook installation (next section below) then use Google Colab
* Colab requires a Google login (that you will already have if you use gmail) and
  uses GoogleDrive for storage.
* The Google Colab user interface is different from Jupyter Notebook but straight forward to use.

To start this practical using Google Colab:
* **Watch this video showing how to use Colab**
  *TODO: osmart 23 Sep 2019: Record video on Colab* then ... 
* [workbook_A.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camgenomicmedicine/GMO7-Jupyter/blob/main/workbook_A.ipynb)
* [homework_A.ipynb ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
  ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ARU-Bioinf-IBDS/prac-A/blob/master/homework_A.ipynb)

Each notebook has a button at the top which says Open in Colab. Click this to start a Colab session for that notebook.
