## Welcome to GMO7 Jupyter practicals <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ciw27npgqdxk0g6/pgstudytransparentpng.png?dl=1" width="150" height="150" style="float:right">

In these practicals we will cover how to use some simple computational tools for Genomic Medicine. These practicals are hosted on GitHub, and are designed to be as user friendly as possible. You do not need a special computer, you do not need to know how computers work. All that is required is a modern up to date web browser, such as Google Chrome.

The practicals themselves will be run in Google Colab. To do this you will need to use a google account. As members of the University you all have a Google account associated with your CRSID. When you try and log in you will be taken to the Raven authentication page. For more details about G-suite at Cambridge see [the UIS webpage](https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/news/gsuite-7-05-19).

### Getting started

The first thing you need to do is to watch the video on the VLE explaining what Jupyter and GitHub are, and why they have revolutionised the way we do data science.
Then, open the first notebook using Google Colab.
